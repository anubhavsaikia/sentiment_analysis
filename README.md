# sentiment_analysis

A neural network to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The neural network uses a modified attention model
that gives importance to certain parts of the sentence to discern the polarity of the review. The network was trained on the 
IMDB training set with 25,000 sample reviews (some of which are quite long), on a gpu over 4 epochs that took 20 minutes to 
train and achieved an accuarcy of about 97.44%.
